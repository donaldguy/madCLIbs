# MadCLI</tt>bs:<br> User-Friendly Fill-in-the-Blank(s) UX for your Terminal Application

Seeks to mimic the familiar UX of HTML5 form elements, with
[placeholders](http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html#placeholder),
in the terminal.

Allows a program to present a line with one or more "blanks" which can be edited and moved between
at will (with tab or up & down arrow keys). On new line, returns the values of the blanks (treating
placeholders as a default values)

The name is supposed to be Mad Libs with a CLI in it, but you might also
reasonably call it "Mad CLI BS" :smile:

You could, in fact, use it to make a sweet Mad Libs app, but its also
pretty useful for things like [Dramaturg](https://github.com/donaldguy/dramaturg)
(for which it was created)
